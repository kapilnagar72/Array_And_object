# Array_And_object

             ** Arrays **

1. What is the default value of Array for different data types?
Ans : Initialize an array using length
Data Type	Default Values
Long	   0
Float 	 0.0
Double	 0.0
Boolean	 false

2. Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
Ans : Array dimensions cannot have a negative size

3. Where does Array stored in JVM memory ?
Ans : Memory is allocated in Heap are for the Array in Java. In Java reference types are stored in the Heap area.
As arrays are also reference types, (they can be created using the “new” keyword) they are also stored in the Heap area.

4. What are the disadvantages of Array?
Ans : Disadvantages of Arrays in Java
The size of the array cannot be increased or decreased once it is declared—arrays have a fixed size.
Java cannot store heterogeneous data. It can only store a single type of primitives.

5. What is an Anonymous Array in Java ? Give an example?
Ans : An array in Java without any name is known as an anonymous array. It is an array just for creating and using instantly.
 Using an anonymous array, we can pass an array with user values without the referenced variable

 6.What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java?
 Ans : For Loop to Traverse Arrays. We can use iteration with a for loop to visit each element of an array.
 This is called traversing the array. Just start the index at 0 and loop while the index is less than the length of the array.

7. What is the difference between length and length() method Give an Examples?
Ans : length is a field, containing the capacity (NOT the number of elements the array contains at the moment) of arrays.
 length() is a method used by Strings (amongst others), it returns the number of chars in the String; with Strings,
 capacity and number of containing elements (chars) have the same value.
